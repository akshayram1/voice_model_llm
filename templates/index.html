      <p>Photosynthesis is the process by which plants, algae, and some bacteria convert light energy from the sun into chemical energy in the form of glucose (a type of sugar). This process is essential for life on Earth, as it provides energy and organic compounds for plants to grow and thrive. Here's a simplified overview of the photosynthesis process:</p>
      <p>**Step 1: Light absorption** Light from the sun is absorbed by pigments such as chlorophyll, which is present in the cells of plants and other photosynthetic organisms. **Step 2: Water absorption** Water is absorbed from the soil through the roots of plants. **Step 3: Carbon dioxide absorption** Carbon dioxide is absorbed from the air through small openings on the surface of leaves called stomata. **Step 4: Light-dependent reactions** The absorbed light energy is used to convert water and carbon dioxide into a molecule called ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which is a source of energy for the plant. **Step 5: Light-independent reactions (Calvin cycle)** The ATP produced in the light-dependent reactions is used to convert carbon dioxide into glucose (C6H12O6) through a series of chemical reactions. **Step 6: Oxygen release** As a byproduct of photosynthesis, oxygen is released into the atmosphere.</p>
